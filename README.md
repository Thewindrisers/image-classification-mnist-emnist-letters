## Vanishing Gradient Problem
When training the neural network, during the backpropogation in each subsequent layer, the gradient in earlier layers get exponientially smaller and smaller ([vanishing](https://github.com/zmandyhe/image-classification-mnist-emnist-letters/blob/master/pic/vanishing-gradient.png)), which makes the network learning very little/slow to improve.  

Potential Solutions include:
- Batch normalization, which is to normalize the activations of the previous layer at each batch, i.e. applies a transformation that maintains the mean activation close to 0 and the activation standard deviation close to 1 to reduce the oscillations of in the distribution of activation. Deep network can be trained faster and better when the activation is normalized during backpropogation.
- Use ReLu activation will normally solve the vanishing gradient problem (not sigmoid).
- Using Regularization to modify cost function to penalize larger weights.
- Use different weight initialization, mementum, etc.
- Use more data.
- Modify architecture.
