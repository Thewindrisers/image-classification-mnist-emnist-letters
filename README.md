# **Image Classification on MNIST and EMNIST Letters**
The project is to train a deep neural network to classify images on MNIST and EMNIST datasets.

## Environment

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Sklearn
* scipy
* numpy
* cv2
* matplotlib


Below shows the lane boundary detection drew back onto its original road image.
