# **Image Classification on MNIST and EMNIST Letters**
The project is to train a deep neural network to classify images on MNIST and EMNIST datasets.

## Environment

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Sklearn
* scipy
* numpy
* cv2
* matplotlib

## Vanishing Gradient Problem
When training the neural network, during the backpropogation in each subsequent layer, the gradient in earlier layers get exponientially smaller and smaller (vanishing), which makes the network learning very little/slow to improve.
